#Ignite UI directives for AngularJS (Preview) 
Use the directives found in `igniteui-angular.js` to use [Ignite UI](http://igniteui.com) controls in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.com) pages. [Work with the running samples here](http://igniteui.github.io/igniteui-angular).
#Requirements

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.7 and later
- [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) v1.0 and later
- [Ignite UI](http://www.igniteui.com) 13.1 and later

#Building
Build will produce an obfuscated and minified version of the `src/igniteui-angular.js` in the `dist/igniteui-angular.min.js`.
Build uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), so you need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
To build the project use the following steps:
1. Open a console in the folder where the igniteui-angular project is located
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt build`
